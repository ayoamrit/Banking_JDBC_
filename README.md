## Java and MySQL Program for Banking Application System
The program allows the user to use numerous banking functions/tools while saving user data in a MySQL database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) 
which provides an API to connect, execute, and fetch data from the database. Furthermore, some of the tasks covered include connecting to database, creating MySQL statements,
executing MySQL queries in the database, and viewing & modifying the resulting records. Lastly, the program is neatly written and defined, and the classes are 
stored in packages.

#### To use functions and tools, users must first register and login to their account.
#### The following are the functions:
- Adding funds to your account 
- Withdrawing funds from your account
- Transferring/Sending money between accounts
- Requesting money from other users. A notification is sent to the user, from whom the customer would like to request money.
- Deleting your account
- Signing out
